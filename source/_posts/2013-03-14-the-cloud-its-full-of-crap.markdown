While I don't really want to polute my tech/philsoosphy/entrepreneurial thoughts with every gag I come across, I thought there was one project in particular that deserved some mention. After all, I spent about an hour laughing after install it - and continue to be amused. 


The project is a Chrome extension that [converts 'The Cloud' to 'My Butt'](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) in any text on a web page you're viewing.


There are many similar projects that do everything from converting pronoun genders to hiding photos of babies - but this was especially meaningful to me for two reasons. 

* I'm pretty sure that 99% of the time "the cloud" is used when talking about tech, the person has no idea what that means
* Butts MUST be the subject of some of the oldest jokes in human history.


This Chrome extension isn't "formally approved" so you'll have to install it manually. To do this: Download the extension from the link above, open your Extension window/view in Chrome and drag the downloaded extension file into that window.


Then enjoy. (ReadWriteWeb loves "the cloud", so they have lots of gems - [How To Store Your Files in The Cloud](http://readwrite.com/2011/11/21/how_to_store_your_files_in_the_cloud))


(One of the best/worsts I've seen yet)
