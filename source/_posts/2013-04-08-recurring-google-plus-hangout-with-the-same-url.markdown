Two weeks from today I will begin a new experiment - working remotely from SF. Participating in our daily [Stand-up meeting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting) at 9am is a SUPER priority, and as a Lead Engineer it is instrumental to my duties.

Under great pressure from [Christina](https://plus.google.com/103846222472267112072) (my wife the Googler), I started looking through the Google+ Hangout docs. Her and I use Hangouts regularly since she's in SF without me for now, and the video/sound quality has always impressed me. Right away I found that there was no easy way to setup or hack an automated Hangout into happening.  However I found that Google had integrated Hangouts into Google Calendar. Basically, you are able to create a Hangout for all invitees of a meeting and the Hangout/URL are pre-generated when the invite is sent out. This reserves the URL for all future use.

I read in a few places about [creating an event in the far future and re-using that reserved Hangout URL](http://blog.singly.com/2012/07/09/from-itch-to-scratched-google-hangout-permalink/) - but this sounded like a breakable idea.

The kernel idea was good though, and I tried something next that really did work well - I created a recurring 9am Stand-up meeting on my calendar (that went on "forever") and added a Google+ Hangout to the event. This did the trick.
The Hangout URL wasn't just pre-generated for each meeting, but the SAME URL was used every time. This reserved our Stand-up meeting Hangout URL basically forever.

Kudos Google!
