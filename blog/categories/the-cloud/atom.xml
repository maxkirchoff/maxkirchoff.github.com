    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While I don't really want to polute my tech/philsoosphy/entrepreneurial thoughts with every gag I come across, I thought there was one project in particular that deserved some mention. After all, I spent about an hour laughing after install it - and continue to be amused.</p>

<p>The project is a Chrome extension that <a href="https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt">converts 'The Cloud' to 'My Butt'</a> in any text on a web page you're viewing.</p>

<p>There are many similar projects that do everything from converting pronoun genders to hiding photos of babies - but this was especially meaningful to me for two reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm pretty sure that 99% of the time "the cloud" is used when talking about tech, the person has no idea what that means</li>
<li>Butts MUST be the subject of some of the oldest jokes in human history.</li>
</ul>


<p>This Chrome extension isn't "formally approved" so you'll have to install it manually. To do this: Download the extension from the link above, open your Extension window/view in Chrome and drag the downloaded extension file into that window.</p>

<p>Then enjoy. (ReadWriteWeb loves "the cloud", so they have lots of gems - <a href="http://readwrite.com/2011/11/21/how_to_store_your_files_in_the_cloud">How To Store Your Files in The Cloud</a>)</p>

<p>(One of the best/worsts I've seen yet)</p>
